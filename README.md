## Concept

A user is walking around Helsinki city centre looking for a place to eat.

## Input

• List of coordinates that represents user’s location on a timeline.
• API endpoint that accepts a location and returns a list of venues next to it.

## Task

Build an app that displays a list of venues for the current location of user. The list should contain a maximum of ​15​ venues. If the server response has more then use the first ​15​. Current location is taken from the input list and changes every ​10​ seconds (your app should refresh the list automatically).

Each venue also has “Favorite” action next to it. “Favorite” works as a toggle (true/false) and changes the icon depending on the state. Your app should remember these states and reapply them to venues that come from the server again.

## How it's made

- [x] Architecture: MVVM + Coordinator
- [x] Venues Service implemented with Combine framework
- [x] Favorite venues can be filtered
- [x] Timer is not working on background mode but it's added a bit workaround solution with Date
- [x] Added simple transition animatins
